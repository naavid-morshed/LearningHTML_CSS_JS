responsive image:
    1. <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
        [If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, 
         but never scale up to be larger than its original size]
    2.  <img src="img_girl.jpg" style="width:100%;">
        [If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down]
    3. <h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1>
        [The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width".
         That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window]
